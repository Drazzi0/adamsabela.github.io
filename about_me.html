                                                Since birth I have loved all the fantastic things from Power Rangers, Knights of the Zodiac, then being a bit older Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the worlds of Marvel and DC. Despite growing up I am still fascinated by these worlds and I am looking for new details from these worlds that I did not know before. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Playing computer games also accompanied me almost from the beginning, starting with Commodore, then Amiga, then Pegasus and PSX until finally learning the magic of PC master race. Don't misunderstand me, consoles were a big factor in my life, but being a player who likes RTS games, I had no choice but to finally build my own PC, which was a memorable experience. From that time I am up to date with the news about new cpu's, gpu's and all that.
                                            </p>

                                              Being a little bit older, while playing games I get very involved in the game world, its history and mechanics. That's why I started playing Dungeons and Dragons as Dungeon Master. Creating a campaign that will have a great impact on players is really rewarding.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                My dream job would be to play in the NBA, but as they say, whites can't jump. So it would "satisfy" me if I could create, or at least help to create, games with a rich world history.

											<h3>Education</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">

											<p>In 2014 I started studying at the Technical University of Lodz. After few years I finally got myself together, passed all my classes and finished my engineer paper. It lasted so long mainly because of health accidents. </p>
											<br>
											<p>In the summer of 2019 I participated in an internship at Likaon/WJTeam. During the internship we dealt with different stages of film creation. At the beginning we created scripts, storyboards and mood boards. Then we got to know Adobe After Effects, ZBrush and Adobe Premier Pro programs. At the end, in groups, we did the project we were assigned.</p>
