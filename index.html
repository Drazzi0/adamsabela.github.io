							<h2>Game Jams!</h2>
							<p>At my university were organized game jams. I was very curious with my friends about these events, but I quickly noticed that you have to come with your own team. If you don't have a team, you will have to join another one, but unfortunately most groups usually don't want other people, and if there is a group that will accept you, your opinion is rarely taken into account when making up the game. Unfortunately for me it's one of the best parts of creating a game, so I quickly lost the enthusiasm to attend.</p>
							<div class="items style3 big onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<h3>Ludum Dare 38 - Lymphocyte Counterattack</h3>
									<p>It was the first edition of the jam game for all people on my team. The theme of this edition was A Small World. We created a game based on the famous game Space Impact, except that the game was played in the human body, and we controlled the white blood cell, which was protecting organism against viruses and bacteria. </p>
									<p>Game is available here: <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/lymphocyte-counterattack">Click</a></p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Ludum Dare 40 - Thief</h3>
									<br>
									<p>The 40th edition was special for me, because one person had a call from work and had to leave even before topic was announced. There was no one to join our ranks. After announcing the topic, we immediately had an idea, that unfortunatelly beat us. We did not manage to finish the game in time, we were not even halfway through.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Ludum Dare 44 - Dead Sirius</h3>
									<p>In the 44th edition I took part in a completely new team, more harmonious. Jam theme was "Your life is currency", we came up with a tower defense type game, where you will play as a necromancer with the ability to summon the undead, for a cost of your own health. Unfortunately, we came up with an idea to create this game with multiplayer option, but we couldn't fulfill this idea and agreed stay with gameplay against the computer.</p>
